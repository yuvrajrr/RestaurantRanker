# RestaurantRanker
Restaurant Ranker

This program will search for the health inspection score of an inputed restaurant. <br/>
The user will also be given a list of alternative restaurants with better (or equal) health inspection ratings and can choose to go to those if they want.<br/>
Given the new restaurants the user chooses, the program will construct the shortest and most optimal route to visit all of the restaurants.

Run the Model.java file to run the program.<br/>
Include java-json.jar in the build path of the project.<br/>
Download the data at: https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Restaurant-and-Market-Health-Violations/ckya-qgys and include it in the data folder. 

The program will prompt for your current location provided it is in the LA area (ex. 2800 E Observatory Rd, LA, CA) -> use this while running or any other address with this format in LA. <br/>
The program will allow for several restaurants to be entered (ex. Pizza Hut, Burger King...)<br/>
Based on the device that the program is being run on, it may take a short amount of time to see the results get displayed, so make sure not to terminate the program early
